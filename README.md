## Styling (CSS)

The webpage uses **flexbox** layout, which centers the content. Each website box has a logo and a name with hover animation that scales the box up slightly for better visual effect. The content is wrapped in a responsive grid system.

## External Libraries Used
- Bootstrap 5.2 (for grid layout and animations)
- Popper.js (for tooltips and popovers in Bootstrap)
- Icons (e.g., "bi bi-globe" from Bootstrap Icons)

## Notes
- The website logos are placed within `div` elements with a hover effect.
- The page is designed to be responsive, showing 4 items per row on medium screens, and adjusting accordingly on smaller screens.
